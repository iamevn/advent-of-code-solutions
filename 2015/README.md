# advent-of-solutions
My Advent of Code solutions, each in a different language.

Nothing really to see here. Had some fun doing the first one in my 
own [silly language](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Wordy) and decided
not to use the same language twice since.

This ended up falling through because I had a hard time learning
enough of a new langauge every day to solve these problems. I
intend to come back and finish the ones I missed but ignoring the
language choice restriction I placed on myself.
